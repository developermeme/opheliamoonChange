      <h4 className="policy-subhead u-h4">General Rules for Return Policy</h4>
      <p className="policy-text  u-h4">
        In possible cases where the seller is unable to process a replacement
        for any reason whatsoever, a refund will be given to the customer.
      </p>
      <p className="policy-text  u-h4">
        During the product deliveries, while accepting your order, if you
        received a different or a damaged product, you will be given a refund
        (on the spot refunds for cash-on-delivery orders). Once you have
        accepted the delivery box, no return request will be processed, except
        for manufactures defects. In such cases, these category-specific
        replacement/return general conditions will be applicable.
      </p>

      <p className="policy-text  u-h4">
        Any specified product-related issues will be rechecked by authorized
        service personnel (free of cost) and attempted to resolve by replacing
        the faulty/defective part of the product. Full replacement will be
        provided only in such cases where the service personnel submit that
        replacing the faulty/defective part will not resolve the issue.
